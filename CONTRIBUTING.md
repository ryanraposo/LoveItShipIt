LoveIt;ShipIt is a reaffirmation from maintainers who want contributors to know that it is...

    1. The order of operations in the project, and so better stands to be.
    2. The standard for all changes, and so better stands to be.
    3. The ideal communication between members of the project, above all else.

[maintainer] has reaffirmed with honest belief that...

    1. These reaffirmations preserve the true value of the project.
    2. Contributors can expect the highest degree of respect as a result.
    3. With belief that doing so is the surest way to invoke the sentiment from users.
